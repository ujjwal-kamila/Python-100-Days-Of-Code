Modes in file : 

There are various modes in which we can open files.

1.read (r): This mode opens the file for reading only and gives an error if the file does not exist. This is the default mode if no mode is passed as a parameter.

2.write (w): This mode opens the file for writing only and creates a new file if the file does not exist.

3.append (a): This mode opens the file for appending only and creates a new file if the file does not exist.

4.create (x): This mode creates a file and gives an error if the file already exists.

5.text (t): Apart from these modes we also need to specify how the file must be handled. t mode is used to handle text files. t refers to the text mode. There is no difference between r and rt or w and wt since text mode is the default. The default mode is 'r' (open for reading text, synonym of 'rt' ).

6.binary (b): used to handle binary files (images, pdfs, etc).
