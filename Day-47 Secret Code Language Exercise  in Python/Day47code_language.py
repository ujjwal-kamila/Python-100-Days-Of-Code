# Day-47 Secret Code Language Exercise  in Python

# Write a python program to translate a message into secret code language. Use the rules below to translate normal English into secret code language

# Coding:
# if the word contains atleast 3 characters, remove the first letter and append it at the end
#   now append three random characters at the starting and the end
# else:
#   simply reverse the string

# Decoding:
# if the word contains less than 3 characters, reverse it
# else:
#   remove 3 random characters from start and end. Now remove the last letter and append it to the beginning
# Your program should ask whether you want to code or decode

st = input("Enter  your message : ")
words = st.split(" ")
coding = input("1 for Coding or 0 for Decoding : ")
coding = True if (coding=="1") else False
print(coding)
if(coding):
  nwords = []
  for word in words:
    if(len(word)>=3):
      r1 = "dsf"
      r2 = "jkr"
      stnew = r1+ word[1:] + word[0] + r2
      nwords.append(stnew)
    else:
      nwords.append(word[::-1])
  print(" ".join(nwords))

#for decoding
else:
  nwords = []
  for word in words:
    if(len(word)>=3): 
      stnew = word[3:-3]
      stnew = stnew[-1] + stnew[:-1] 
      nwords.append(stnew)
    else:
      nwords.append(word[::-1])
  print(" ".join(nwords))

# # Function to translate a message into secret code language based on specific rules

# # - For words with 3 or more characters: Remove the first letter, append it at the end, and add three random characters at the start and end
# # - For words with less than 3 characters: Simply reverse the string
